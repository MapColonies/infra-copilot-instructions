- Always add a comment 'Generated by Copilot'.
- Use jest for testing.
- Use the 'it' function for test cases.
- Group tests for the same function in the same describe block.
- Use the 'describe' function to group tests.
- Tests should be black-box tests.
- Test should test `happy`, `sad`, and `bad` cases.
  - `happy` - the test should test success (e.g. 200 status in http).
  - `sad` - the test should test unexpected failures (e.g. 500 status in http).
  - `bad` - the test should test bad input (e.g. 4xx status in http).
- Prefer using matchers that convey the intent of the test.
- use the jest-extended library for additional matchers.
- Each test MUST be structured as follows:
  - Arrange: set up the test.
  - Act: perform the test.
  - Assert: check the result.
- Tests must be independent of each other.
- use expect.assertions to ensure that a certain number of assertions are called.
- use the `@faker-js/faker` library to generate random data for tests.
- When writing integration tests, use the `nock` library to mock http requests.
- When writing integration tests, use real database connections when possible.
